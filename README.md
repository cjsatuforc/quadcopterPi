quadcopterPi
============
quadcopter controlled by raspberry Pi


For each component of a quadcopter I created a object in Python:
motor.py  ( and motor_test.py  for testing the single component)
sensor.py (and sensor_test.py)
rc.py - remote control emulator - (and rc_test.py)
pid.py
netscan.py ( under development)
logger_manager.py
and so on...
